Hi, I am student at the University of Cambridge studying the Masters in Engineering course.

I am interested in HDR technology and am experienced with HDR workflows, including 
- Log to HDR video creation in DaVinci Resolve
- RAW to HDR image workflow in darktable with an emphasis on colour accuracy (the image matches the log version in DaVinci Resolve after colour space transform)

<!-- I have also worked on implementing PQ HDR PNG screenshots and chroma 4:4:4 screen recordings for QuickRecorder, the only screen recording app on macOS that records in HDR (as of May 2025). I have co-implemented color management in macOS for MLV App, an open source RAW video color grading application. -->

I have also published *Training Neural Networks on RAW and HDR Images for Restoration Tasks* to NTIRE2025, a CVPR workshop. It can be accessed at https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03640
